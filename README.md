Hi! I'm Aleksei Rovenich, a cibersecurity student with a passion for coding. I've been studying different programming languages and coding for around 10 years.

On all this journey i've been working on different personal project that has been lost in old computers,
but hey, its part of learning to just one day start using github.

Right now i'm interested on reverse engineering and backend coding.


You can contact me via dms in twitter @rootAlekseiRov.

Have a nice day :)
